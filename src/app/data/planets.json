    "description": "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest one in our solar system. Despite being nearest to the Sun, it's not the hottest—that title goes to Venus. Mercury has no atmosphere to retain heat, so it experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, from scorching 430°C during the day to -180°C at night. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling Earth’s moon, and it's thought to have a large metallic core which generates a weak magnetic field. Due to its slow rotation and fast orbit, a day on Mercury (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 176 Earth days.",

    "description": "Venus, often referred to as Earth's twin because of its similar size and composition, is a hellish world with a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide. Its surface pressure is about 92 times that of Earth’s, equivalent to being 900 meters underwater. The planet is perpetually shrouded in thick sulfuric acid clouds, trapping heat and creating a runaway greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures over 460°C. Interestingly, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets and very slowly—a day on Venus is longer than its year.",

It has a unique atmosphere rich in nitrogen and oxygen, a magnetic field that shields it from harmful solar radiation, and abundant liquid water covering about 71% of its surface. Earth’s biosphere supports millions of species, including humans. Tectonic activity, weather systems, and a dynamic climate make it an ever-changing world.
